## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis was to study Kickstarter data on campaigns for theater plays in order to determine the viability these campaigns for a client. The client has already almost met their Kickstarter goals and wanted to see the metrics on other similar Kickstarter campaigns. This data can help to infer how many similar scaled projects met their goals and can help the client tailor goals of future projects in such a way where they are most likely to be met.  

## Analysis and Challenges: 
The analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel's various formulas, pivot tables, and charts. The pivot tables used filters to hone in on the client's desired data, separating the data from the larger categories. The extraction of this data facilitated the chart visualizations. 

## Results:
May and June are the months with the most successful campaigns. Summer Months have the most successful campaigns and there is a significant drop in the Winter months. In the Outcomes Based on Goals dataset, the most modest goals overall have a much higher chance of being successful. As the goals increase, there is a drop off in the success rate. This data is limited in that there is a lack of specific demographic data of those pledging money, such as age, gender, and geographic area (more specific than country), etc. Further visualizations could analyze the potential effect of a campaign being a "staff pick" and the average amount of money donated per person.
